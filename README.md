R package to perform Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment for
corporate lending portfolio including matching and analysis module

## Purpose

Package includes useful functions and procedures which can be used by
any user. Purpose of package is to implement support for standard
workflow operartions. Users may use own workflows (different data
formats, different match rules, etc) while still using standard building
blocks.

All package makes available set of functions which are pure in their
behaviour - so they fully depend on input and produce output only
according to input. No IO operations are done inside functions. All file
access for reads and writes are performed script level and not part of
this package.

## Simple package installation

Install R first from [cran](https://cran.r-project.org). Please install
R into local folder. Due to many files R works slowly when it is
installed on network drive.

Enter R envinronment, install additional packages

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "2DegreesInvesting/pacta")
```

## Installation of sources

Please note that `devtools` and `roxygen2` packages is required. This is
easiest way to build packages in R. Please open R session and run
following command

``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2"))
```

After that you can clone git repository into your working folder

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/pacta.git
```

Now everything is ready, you can run RStudio and open project - there is
a Rproj file in the root folder.

``` sh
./pacta.Rproj
```

After project is open it needs to be built. Run
`[Cmd/Ctrl]`+`[Shift]`+`B` to build project. R might request you to
install additional packages used, please refer to `Imports:` section of
package [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION).

## Making changes

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) document that describes
workflow used for changes. Few important rules worth mentioning again:

  - all changes are done via branches, no changes in `master` please;
  - first write test then write functionality - take care of automated
    testing;
  - always biuld - `[Cmd/Ctrl]`+`[Shift]`+`B` - for documentation
    update;
  - always test - `[Cmd/Ctrl]`+`[Shift]`+`T` - to make sure regression
    tests are passing;
  - always check - `[Cmd/Ctrl]`+`[Shift]`+`E` - to make sure package
    passes integration tests and additional checks.

Please keep Warnings and Errors on **zero level**.
